Changes:
- Separated formulas for RYB conversion and subtractive mixing into their own header and source files (RYB.h & RYB.cpp).  They can now be used in stand-alone fashion either with or without Raylib

- Added color sampling functionality -- the "pick color" button
- Changed some font sizes for better legibility
- Simplified some of the code in formulas for better legibility (same functionality)
